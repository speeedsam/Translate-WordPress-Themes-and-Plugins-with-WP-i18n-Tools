To create a language POT (Portable Object Template) file for your WordPress plugin, you'll need to extract translatable strings from your plugin's code and then generate the POT file. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Install and Set Up a Text Editor: You can use any code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) to work on your plugin files. Make sure you have a suitable text editor installed.

2. Internationalize Your Plugin: To make your plugin translatable, you need to wrap the strings you want to translate with translation functions like __() or _e(). For example:

`$text = __('This is a translatable string.', 'your-plugin-text-domain');`
Replace 'your-plugin-text-domain' with the unique text domain for your plugin.

3. Make tools folder `tools` on you project root folder `domain.test/tools` the put all `WP-i18n` files form git repo


4. Navigate to Your project Directory: Open your command prompt or terminal, and navigate to your WordPress directory. For example:

`cd /path/to/your-project/tools`

5. Generate the POT File: Use the wp i18n make-pot command to create the POT file. Replace `your-plugin-text-domain` or your-theme-text-domain with your actual text domain:

Command for theme
```php makepot.php wp-theme ../wp-content/themes/ADD-YOUR-THEME-FOLDER-SLUG ../wp-content/themes/THEME-FOLDER/languages/THEMESLUG.pot```


Command for plugin
```php makepot.php wp-plugin ../wp-content/plugins/ADD-YOUR-PLUGIN-FOLDER-SLUG ../wp-content/plugins/PLUGIN-FOLDER/languages/THEMESLUG.pot```

This command will scan the PHP files in your plugin directory for translatable strings and create a POT file in the languages directory.

6. Review and Customize the POT File: Open the generated your-plugin.pot file using your text editor. You can add additional information like comments and descriptions for translators.

7. Prepare for Localization: You need to provide translations for different languages. Create .po files for each language you want to support. For example, you can create your-plugin-fr_FR.po for French translations.

8. Compile Translations: After making translations, you need to compile them into .mo files using translation tools like Poedit. These .mo files should have the same name as your .po files (e.g., your-plugin-fr_FR.mo).

9. Load Translations in Your Plugin: To load the translated strings in your plugin, use the load_plugin_textdomain() function in your plugin file:

```
load_plugin_textdomain('your-plugin-text-domain', false, dirname(plugin_basename(__FILE__)) . '/languages');
```
10. Test Your Translations: Install your plugin on a WordPress site, and change the site's language to the language for which you've created translations. Make sure the translations are working correctly.

That's it! You've created a POT file and set up translations for your WordPress plugin. Users will now be able to use your plugin in their preferred languages.
